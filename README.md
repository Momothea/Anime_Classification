# Anime_Classification

In this project, my team and I created a complete web application that serves a machine learning model that can predict whether an anime series is enjoyable or not. We applied DevOps principles to develop the application, and train and deploy the machine learning model that handles the predictions.

To run all the containers, run the command:

    docker compose up


test the routes:

python -m unittest
